# Python_Storms_Analysis

## Storms of the Atlantic Basin Analysis

### This analysis was conducted as a part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Course.

## Objective
### Each year storms formed in the Atlantic make landfall over the United States, causing destruction to property and peronsal injury or loss of life.
### Can an analysis of historical storm data help the US prepare for future storms?

## Tools:
### Python libraries used:
- pandas - for analysis
- matplotlib and seaborn - for visualizations

## Data:
### Find the dataset sourced from NOAA's hurricane database subset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christinezinkand/storms?select=storms.csv)
